## How to perform “Tap-to-Interact”

<include>../start/action.mdx</include>

## “App Clip” unavailable

If you see “App Clip unavailable” after a tap-to-interact action, it means you have not yet installed the Dot. App. After <Link href="/docs/dot/install_app">installing the latest version of the app</Link>, you can use tap-to-interact.

This error occurs because the current App Clip size exceeds Apple’s system limit for “launching an App Clip without installing the main app.” We are working to reduce the App Clip size so it can be invoked directly without the main app.

### iPhone

If tap-to-interact does not launch the App Clip on iPhone, try locking your iPhone, unlocking it again, then move the iPhone from low to high and approach the right side of the device. This usually triggers the App Clip correctly.

This issue is generally due to iOS system limitations. When you tap multiple times from the same App Clip source, iOS may block subsequent launches. Only after you lock the screen and then approach with a larger movement will iOS invoke the App Clip again.

If you are using a Mainland China iPhone, check whether NFC is enabled in Settings → General.

### Android

If tap-to-interact does not redirect correctly on Android, ensure the Dot. App is installed, NFC is enabled, and you know your Android device’s NFC sensing area.

Bring that area close to the blank area on the right side of the device to invoke the content.
