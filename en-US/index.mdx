Welcome to the Dot. App Manual! Here you can find detailed guides on using the Dot. App and Dot. series products, answers to frequently asked questions, and the latest release notes.

Dot. is committed to offering a more restrained and tranquil approach to the complexity and fragmentation of modern life. Through calmer interactions, we let the digital world blend into everyday living.

We recognize that while the digital age brings many conveniences, it also presents many challenges—an excess of symbols and noise can at times hinder deeper communication and spiritual elevation. What Dot. strives to do right now is simply to gently and calmly open a window for everyone, quietly and seamlessly, allowing daily life to merge with more dimensions and more inspiration. So that everyone can capture that faint glimmer in ordinary life—the moment when thoughts are rekindled.
