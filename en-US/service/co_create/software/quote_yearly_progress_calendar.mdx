A yearly calendar display solution based on the Quote/0 official Image API, Apple Shortcuts, and local automation: push one 1-bit style calendar image to the device each day, avoiding high-frequency refreshes while clearly presenting the progress of the year.

## Features

-   Automatically updates one calendar image per day (1-bit style)
-   Top area: date, weekday, battery percentage, day index of the year
-   Bottom area with 365 dots: three states indicate past/today/future to visualize yearly progress
-   Customizable API key and device ID
-   Supports scheduled local automation (no manual action required)

## How It Works

1.  Asset generation
    -   Use Python to batch-generate 365 calendar images (1-bit style).
    -   Separate dynamic elements (date, weekday, percentage, etc.) into independent assets for easier composition.
    -   Convert all images to base64 and bundle them into a single JSON file.
2.  Shortcuts side
    -   Read the JSON and locate the image by today’s index.
    -   Use the Get Contents of URL action to call the Quote/0 Image API and push to the device.
3.  Display
    -   Top: date, weekday, percentage, day-of-year.
    -   Bottom: 365 dots, with three-state rendering for yearly progress.
