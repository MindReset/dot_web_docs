An API is a bridge that enables communication and data exchange between different software applications. Simply put, an API is like a “translator” or a “waiter” that helps different programs “talk” to each other.

## How does an API work?

<Steps>
  <Step>
### You send a request

“Please display ‘The weather is great today’ on the device.”

  </Step>
    <Step>
### The API processes the request

After receiving the request, the API performs user and device verification to ensure it comes from a legitimate user and device.

  </Step>
    <Step>
### The device performs the action

The device receives the command and displays the text on the screen.

  </Step>
    <Step>
### Return the result
“Operation successful. The content is now displayed on the device.”

  </Step>
</Steps>

Therefore, the Dot. API enables you to:

- Automatically display the subject and part of the content when you receive an important email
- Automatically display verification codes on the device when an SMS code arrives
- Show visitor information on the device when the doorbell rings
- Present highly personalized layouts, such as a personal information dashboard
- Display fun images or emojis

## Who can use the Developer Platform?

1. Power users: Create simple automation using no-code tools (e.g., Shortcuts, IFTTT, Zapier)
2. Developers: Write code to build complex automation systems
3. Enterprise users: Integrate Dot. into existing business systems to improve efficiency
4. Anyone interested in IoT devices and automation
