## App shows activation successful, but Quote/0 does not respond, or the App stays on device configuration for a long time after showing activation successful

<div className="flex flex-col md:flex-row gap-4">
	<CustomCloudImage osSrc="dot/docs/pair_issues_case_2_1.png" alt="Device not responding" />

</div>

Quote/0 typically completes activation reporting and self-configuration within a dozen seconds, up to about 1 minute at most.

    - Ensure the network is smooth and keep the device close to the router;
    - If configuration does not complete for an extended period and Quote/0 shows “Waiting for pairing to complete,” try unplugging and reconnecting the cable to reconfigure;
    - If the Quote/0 screen has changed but remains unresponsive for a long time, try <Link href="/docs/quote_0/firmware/update_firmware">updating the device</Link> and then <Link href="/docs/quote_0/firmware/reset_network">resetting the network</Link>, and try again;
    - If your router has MAC address filtering enabled, add the Quote/0 MAC (serial number) to the whitelist (see <Link href="/docs/server/template/api/get_device_id">Get Device Serial Number</Link>), then <Link href="/docs/quote_0/firmware/reset_device">reset the device</Link> and pair again;
    - If your router has traffic splitting, proxy, firewall, or domain allow/deny lists enabled, add `*.mindreset.tech` to the allowlist or relevant policy.

### Further troubleshooting

You can use a mobile hotspot to temporarily check whether the issue is network-related. After enabling your mobile hotspot (enable any compatibility options if prompted), select the hotspot during pairing and see if pairing succeeds.

If it does, further check your router or network settings to ensure the device can connect to the internet properly.
