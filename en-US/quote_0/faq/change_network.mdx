title: How to Switch Networks
---

<Callout type="info" title="Why doesn’t Quote/0 support multiple networks?">

Quote/0 was initially designed as a “smart home” device. It is intended to be used “on a fixed, stable network,” so it does not support multi-network switching. However, you can still switch networks by resetting the network.

</Callout>

## Connect the device to the web tool

<include>../firmware/device_tool_connect.mdx</include>

## Next step

Tap “Reset Network” below. After the device screen changes, you can use the Dot. App to re-pair the device’s network.

	If the screen does not change, try disconnecting, refreshing the page, and reconnecting before
	trying again.
