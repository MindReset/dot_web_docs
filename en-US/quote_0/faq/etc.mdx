## Why is there a large blank area on the right side

<CustomCloudImage osSrc="dot/device/quote_0_1/none.png" alt="Quote/0" />

The large area on the right side of Quote/0 draws on Dieter Rams’ design methods and philosophy. It is not a simple “empty space,” but a refined design known as “negative space.”

Functionally, it houses an 800 mAh battery pack and an NFC module, providing a broad interaction hot zone. Aesthetically, it balances the visually dense screen on the left, anchoring the user’s focus on the core content and creating a calm “breathing” rhythm.

## Why only 2.4 GHz networks are supported

2.4 GHz Wi‑Fi speed is sufficient for the device’s needs, and its radio signal travels farther and penetrates walls, floors, and other obstacles more easily.

This means that no matter how far the device is from the router, it can still maintain a stable and reliable signal, avoiding frequent disconnects.

## Weak/poor/dropped signal

The 2.4 GHz band is relatively noisy, and some APs on the market have simplified the 2.4 GHz FEM power amplifier.

If your network environment is poor or your router has too many devices connected, try temporarily disconnecting some unused devices and moving the device closer to the router to see if the situation improves.

## Why content cannot be updated promptly

Quote/0 is a smart home device with a low‑power autonomous wake design.

When the device is not fetching or refreshing content, it actually disconnects from the network and sleeps. Your settings are stored on the server; when it wakes, it fetches your saved configuration and applies it automatically. So simply configure as normal—it will apply changes on the next wake cycle.

## What is the logic for content updates

Quote/0 supports multiple content modes: loop, fixed, and temporary.

The current app has enabled the loop mode; other modes will be rolled out via hot updates.
Loop content means “how long to wait between each item in the loop”:

-       The device displays content according to the order in the loop list
-       You can long‑press and drag to reorder items in the loop
-       You can tap “More” on the right to immediately display the current item
    In the app, tap “Adjust Interval Time” above the loop list to set different intervals.

When the device runs on battery, longer intervals extend battery life because the device sleeps during the interval; however, content freshness decreases. If the device is plugged in, the loop interval can be as short as 5 minutes, maximizing content timeliness.

## Magnetic attachment is not firm

Please check whether the back of Quote/0 is flat. Protrusions or indentations on the back may affect magnetic adhesion.
