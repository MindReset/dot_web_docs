title: How to Change Networks
---

<Callout type="info" title="Why doesn’t Quote/0 support multiple networks?">

Quote/0 was originally designed as a "smart home" device. It is intended for use "on a fixed, stable network," therefore it does not support multi-network switching. However, you can still change networks by resetting the network configuration.

## Connect the Device to the Web Tool

## Next Steps

Tap "Reset Network" below. After the device screen changes, you can use the Dot. App to reconfigure the device's network settings.
