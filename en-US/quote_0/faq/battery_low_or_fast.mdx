title: Battery too low / Battery draining too fast

Quote/0 is a smart home device featuring a low-power autonomous wake design. It ships with approximately 70% battery capacity and is recommended for use exclusively in stable home environments.

<Callout type="info">
	<include>../start/how_to_charge.mdx</include>
</Callout>

When operating solely on battery power under favorable signal conditions, with a default update interval of 3 hours or longer, the battery can last up to one year.

If you observe that Quote/0's battery is draining too quickly, please be aware of two potential causes:

1. Update interval is too short: When you set the update interval to less than 3 hours, the device will wake and fetch content more frequently, causing the battery to drain faster than anticipated. You can configure a longer update interval in the app to significantly reduce power consumption.
2. Poor Wi‑Fi network: If your Wi‑Fi environment is unstable, you use a mobile hotspot, or the device moves outside the original network range when waking, the device may consume power rapidly due to repeated Wi‑Fi reconnection attempts. For this smart home device, the specific reconnection logic is as follows:
    - Following no response or connection error, the device automatically retries up to 15 times in a loop;
    - If all attempts fail, the device enters sleep mode for two minutes, then automatically wakes and retries;
    - This cycle continues until the device successfully establishes a Wi‑Fi connection.

Therefore, please verify the Wi‑Fi network the device is currently using to ensure reasonable power consumption.

	Laboratory test results indicate that a single charge supports up to 3,900 refresh cycles (with Wi‑Fi reconnection occurring on each wake).
