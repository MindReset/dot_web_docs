This is a 3D‑printed hook model designed specifically for the IKEA SKÅDIS pegboard system, tailored for the Quote/0 smart magnetic e‑ink display. The design offers three angle options—upright (90°), 20° downward tilt, and 20° upward tilt—so you can adjust the viewing angle as needed. The compact hook integrates cleanly into the SKÅDIS ecosystem.

Two model variants are provided:

-        With power and indicator openings: suitable when you need cable access or an LED indicator visible.
-        Without power and indicator openings: a smoother exterior for aesthetics or when no extra openings are required.
