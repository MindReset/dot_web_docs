## Why Is There a Large Blank Area on the Right Side?

<CustomCloudImage osSrc="dot/device/quote_0_1/none.png" alt="Quote/0" />

The large area on the right side of Quote/0 draws inspiration from Dieter Rams' design methodology and philosophy. It is not merely "empty space," but rather a sophisticated design concept known as "negative space."

Functionally, it houses an 800 mAh battery pack and an NFC module, providing an expansive interaction hot zone. Aesthetically, it creates visual balance with the information-dense screen on the left, anchoring the user's focus on the core content and establishing a tranquil "breathing" rhythm.

## Why Only 2.4 GHz Networks Are Supported

The 2.4 GHz Wi‑Fi speed is sufficient for the device's requirements, and its radio signal propagates over longer distances and penetrates walls, floors, and other obstacles more effectively.

This ensures that regardless of the device's distance from the router, it can maintain a stable and reliable connection, preventing frequent disconnections.

## Weak/Poor/Dropped Signal

The 2.4 GHz frequency band is relatively congested, and some access points (APs) on the market have simplified the 2.4 GHz FEM power amplifier.

If your network environment is suboptimal or your router has an excessive number of connected devices, try temporarily disconnecting some unused devices and positioning the device closer to the router to determine if the situation improves.

## Why Content Cannot Be Updated Promptly

Quote/0 is a smart home device featuring a low-power autonomous wake design.

When the device is not actively fetching or refreshing content, it disconnects from the network and enters sleep mode. Your configuration settings are stored on the server; when the device wakes, it retrieves your saved settings and applies them automatically. Therefore, simply configure normally—changes will be applied during the next wake cycle.

## What Is the Logic for Content Updates?

Quote/0 supports multiple content modes: loop, fixed, and temporary.

The current app has enabled loop mode; other modes will be deployed via hot updates.
Loop content refers to "the duration to wait between each item in the loop":

-   The device displays content according to the sequence in the loop list
-   You can long-press and drag to reorder items within the loop
-   You can tap "More" on the right to immediately display the current item

In the app, tap "Adjust Interval Time" above the loop list to configure different intervals.

When operating on battery power, longer intervals extend battery life because the device sleeps during intervals; however, content freshness decreases. If the device is connected to power, the loop interval can be as short as 5 minutes, maximizing content timeliness.

## Magnetic Attachment Is Not Firm

Please verify that the back of Quote/0 is flat. Any protrusions or indentations on the back surface may affect magnetic adhesion.
