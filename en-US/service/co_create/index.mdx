<Callout title="What is Community Co-Creation?">
	Community co-creation revolves around the Dot. ecosystem, where developers, designers, and
	enthusiasts continuously produce apps and integration practices based on open APIs, protocols,
	and examples. It values small-yet-elegant solutions that are "usable and reusable," and also
	encourages an experimental spirit to explore new frontiers of e-paper with AI and automation.
</Callout>

Here, you’ll see how the community seamlessly delivers information like weather, calendars, to-dos, and knowledge bases to e-paper displays; how it achieves clearer reading experiences through a combination of text and image APIs; and how it links desktop agents with physical devices using MCP, webhooks, and automated workflows. These seemingly scattered ideas ultimately converge into a lightweight and efficient mode of human-computer collaboration: information arrives at the right time and in the right context, interfaces remain restrained and readable, and creativity is inspired and evolves along open implementation paths.
