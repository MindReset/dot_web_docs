## What is the Developer Platform?

The Developer Platform is a set of capabilities designed for automation and integrations, including:

- **Credentials & authentication**: Create and manage API keys in the Dot. App.
- **Devices & resources**: Get and use the device serial number (device ID) to target specific devices.
- **Open APIs**: Use standard HTTP requests to control device content, query device status, and list devices.

If you just want to push content to your device quickly, start with “Quick Start”.

### Tips (Security & reliability)

- **Keep your API key safe**: The Dot. App does not store your API key. If you suspect it has been compromised, delete it in the app and create a new one.
