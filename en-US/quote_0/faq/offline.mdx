When you see "Device Offline" in the Dot. App, it indicates that the device cannot establish effective communication with our servers. This issue may be caused by several factors:

### Device Battery Drained

A drained battery is a common cause of devices going offline. The device relies on battery power to maintain normal operation and network connectivity. Please connect the device to an external power source for charging. After charging begins, wait a few minutes to observe whether the device automatically comes back online.

### Network Connection Interrupted

The device's internet connection may be interrupted due to unstable Wi‑Fi signal, router misconfiguration, or hardware failure.

-   Verify that your Wi‑Fi network is functioning properly, and check whether other devices on the network can access the internet.
-   Try restarting your router.
-   Check the device's physical location to ensure it is within Wi‑Fi coverage range and remove any obstacles that may interfere with the signal.

### Network Environment Changed

If the device's working network environment changes (for example, you replace the router or move the device to a new network area), it may go offline because it cannot connect to the previously saved Wi‑Fi network.

Please <Link href="/docs/quote_0/firmware/reset_network">reconfigure the network</Link> to allow the device to join the new Wi‑Fi environment.

### Router Proxy or Firewall Settings

Some routers or network environments may have proxy services or firewall rules configured that block the device from connecting to our cloud services.

-   If your router has MAC address filtering enabled, add the Quote/0 MAC (serial number) to the whitelist (see <Link href="/docs/server/template/api/get_device_id">Get Device Serial Number</Link>), then <Link href="/docs/quote_0/firmware/reset_device">reset the device</Link> and pair again.
-   If your router has traffic splitting, proxy, firewall, or domain allow/deny lists enabled, add `*.mindreset.tech` to the allowlist or relevant policy.

## Still Not Resolved

Try <Link href="/docs/quote_0/firmware/reset_device">resetting the device</Link> and pairing it again; this typically resolves most issues.
