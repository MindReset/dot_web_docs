## How to Perform "Tap-to-Interact"

<include>../start/action.mdx</include>

## “App Clip” unavailable

If you encounter "App Clip unavailable" after a tap-to-interact action, it indicates that you have not yet installed the Dot. App. After <Link href="/docs/dot/install_app">installing the latest version of the app</Link>, you can use tap-to-interact functionality.

This error occurs because the current App Clip size exceeds Apple's system size limit for "launching an App Clip without installing the main app." We are actively working to reduce the App Clip size so it can be invoked directly without requiring the main app installation.

### iPhone

If tap-to-interact fails to launch the App Clip on iPhone, try locking your iPhone, unlocking it again, then move the iPhone in an upward motion and approach the right side of the device. This typically triggers the App Clip correctly.

This issue is generally caused by iOS system limitations. When you attempt to tap multiple times from the same App Clip source, iOS may block subsequent launches. Only after locking the screen and approaching again with a more pronounced movement will iOS invoke the App Clip again.

If you are using an iPhone intended for Mainland China, verify that NFC is enabled in Settings → General.

### Android

If tap-to-interact does not redirect correctly on Android, ensure that the Dot. App is installed, NFC functionality is enabled, and you are aware of your Android device's NFC sensing area location.

Bring the NFC sensing area close to the blank area on the right side of the device to invoke the content.
