title: Service Outage on the Evening of June 23, 2025

At around 20:50 on June 23, 2025, our servers experienced a sudden surge of abnormal requests, causing response slowdowns.

Specific symptoms included:

-   Device list showing empty when opening the app
-   Content Studio failing to load

After urgent investigation and resolution, services were restored to normal by 22:10 that evening.

We understand this may have been your first time using our device, and normal activation and operation depend on our servers. This incident affected your initial experience, and we sincerely apologize. Please be assured that we will continue to optimize and enhance service stability to provide a more reliable experience.

The servers have now been restored. You can try using the service again. If you encounter any issues, please feel free to contact us, and we will be happy to assist you. Thank you for your understanding and support!
