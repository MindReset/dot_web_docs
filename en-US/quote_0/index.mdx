## What is Quote/0

<CustomCloudImage osSrc="dot/docs/quote_0_hero.png" alt="Quote/0" />

Quote/0 is a smart e-ink device that can attach to metal surfaces, designed to help users reduce information overload and improve focus through minimalist design.

You can flexibly configure what it displays via the app, including rich content such as RSS feeds, to-dos, calendars, weather, etc., and orchestrate your own display strategy. You can even share, manage, and control it remotely with family and friends.
With cloud rendering technology, it can present rich layouts and diverse information. When you are interested in the current content or need to take further action, simply tap it with an NFC-enabled phone to invoke the iOS Clip App or Android App for viewing or operation.

The content studio will continue to update and expand. A custom design platform and a lightweight coding system will also be launched in the future.

## Origin Story

The idea for Quote/0 began with a casual brainstorming session, yet it was anchored in a clear feeling: rather than passively receiving vast yet vague information, it’s better to set up an “intentionally chosen” content entry in everyday space.
Placed in a corner of life, it resembles an ongoing private exhibition. You might overlook it, or you might be captivated in a single moment. Compared to other media, Quote/0 may seem clumsier and slower; yet precisely because of this, it returns to you the right to “ignore or gaze,” allowing every encounter or miss to become a conversation shaped by conscious choice.
