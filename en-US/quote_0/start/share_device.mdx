title: Share with Family and Friends
description: By sharing your device, you and your loved ones can experience Quote/0 together and explore more possibilities.

Quote/0 can be shared with friends and family via the Dot. App. After sharing, both parties can view and control the device, but shared users cannot reboot or put the device to sleep.

## Share your device

To share your device with another user, go to “More” at the lower-right of the device card on the Dot. App home screen, or go to the device details in your profile to access the sharing page. This page shows all users with whom the device has been shared.

<div className="flex flex-col md:flex-row gap-4">
	<CustomCloudImage osSrc="dot/docs/share_step_1.png" alt="Share device step 1" />
	<CustomCloudImage osSrc="dot/docs/share_step_2.png" alt="Share device step 2" />
	<CustomCloudImage osSrc="dot/docs/share_step_3.png" alt="Share device step 3" />
</div>

To add a new shared user, tap “Add Share” → “Share.” A QR code and a share code will appear. You can send the sharing info as an image, or send the share code as text to your friend.

</div>

## Accept a shared device from others

Accepting a shared device is similar to adding a device: tap the “+” button in the top-right, then tap “Add Share.”

You can scan the QR code shared by your friend or manually enter the four-character share code. After entering, you will see the device information your friend shared. You can choose to add it or close the dialog.

	<CustomCloudImage osSrc="dot/docs/accept_step_2.png" alt="Accept device step 2" />
	<CustomCloudImage osSrc="dot/docs/accept_step_3.png" alt="Accept device step 3" />

</div>
