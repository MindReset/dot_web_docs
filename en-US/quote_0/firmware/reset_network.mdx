## Connect the device to the web tool

<Callout type="info" title="When do I need to reset the network?">
	When your device cannot connect to the original network, it indicates you need to use the web
	tool to reset the network.
</Callout>

<include>./device_tool_connect.mdx</include>

## Next step

Tap “Reset Network” below. After the device screen changes, you can use the Dot. App to re‑pair the device’s network.

If the screen does not change, try disconnecting, refreshing the page, and reconnecting before trying again.

## Notes

If the account you re‑pair with is the same as the account used before the reset, your previously configured content will be retained. If the account is different (e.g., your friend or someone else), the device’s previously configured content will be removed.
