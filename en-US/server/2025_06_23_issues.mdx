title: Service Outage on the Evening of June 23, 2025
---

At around 20:50 on June 23, 2025, our servers were hit by a sudden surge of abnormal requests, causing response slowdowns.

Symptoms included:

-        Device list showing empty when opening the app;
-        Content Studio failing to load, among other issues.

After urgent investigation and remediation, services were restored to normal by 22:10 that evening.

We fully understand this may have been your first time using our device, and normal activation and operation depend on our servers. This incident negatively affected your first experience, and we sincerely apologize. Please rest assured that we will continue to optimize and enhance service stability to provide a more reliable experience.

The servers have now been fixed; you can try again. If you encounter any further issues, please feel free to contact us. We are committed to assisting you. Thank you for your understanding and support!
