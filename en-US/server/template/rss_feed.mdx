## What is RSS?

RSS (Really Simple Syndication or Rich Site Summary) is a web content aggregation format that allows users to subscribe to updates from websites. With RSS, you can gather the latest articles, news, or updates from multiple sites in one place without visiting each site individually.

RSSHub is an open-source RSS generator that can create RSS feeds for websites that do not provide them. With RSSHub, you can convert content from various websites into RSS format for unified subscription and management. In the Dot. Content Studio, if data parsing shows “RSSHub,” it means the data is generated based on RSSHub’s API.

## Use RSS subscriptions

<Steps>
<Step>
	### Find or obtain an RSS subscription link

    Generally, you can find an RSS subscription link in the footer or sidebar of a website, often labeled “RSS” or “Subscribe.” If the site does not provide an RSS link, you can use the official RSSHub site or your self-hosted RSSHub to generate one.

    Common RSS link formats are `https://example.com/rss` or `https://example.com/feed`.
