## Overview

On 2025-09-29T02:56:00Z, we received a security report about an IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference) issue in the NFC "Tap" flow. The server returned screen content based solely on a provided deviceId without authenticating or authorizing the requester, allowing attackers who know or can guess deviceId values to read a user’s device screen content.

We have completed remediation, released App version 1.1.0, and deployed server-side changes. There is no evidence of malicious exploitation.

## Affected Scope

| Item                     | Details                                                             |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ** Affected Product**    | Dot App (NFC Tap feature)                                           |
| ** Affected Versions**   | App 1.0.x and earlier                                               |
| ** Fixed Version**       | App 1.1.0 (requires latest server-side policies)                    |
| ** Affected Components** | Content-read API (`/api/device/content`) and NFC redirect flow      |
| ** Attack Vector**       | Network (when deviceId is known or guessable)                       |
| ** Required Privilege**  | None (before fix, sensitive content could be returned without auth) |

## Technical Description

-   Flow: NFC tag encodes a link like `https://dot.mindreset.cn/nfc?deviceId=xxxxxx`. After tap, the App is opened, parses deviceId, and requests `/api/device/content` to display screen content.
-   Root cause: The API returned content using only deviceId with no Authentication or Authorization, leading to a typical IDOR risk.
-   deviceId sources: Accidental exposure in shared images, untrusted network environments, or brute-force enumeration in extreme cases.

## Remediation

To balance usability and security, we implemented an App–server coordinated access model aligned with the principles of Informed Consent and DAC (Discretionary Access Control):

-   App (from 1.1.0):
-   New "Tap Access Permission" setting:
    -   Allow everyone to tap
    -   Only me and shared recipients (default)
-   Users can adjust at any time; the setting binds to the device’s content access policy.

-   Server:
-   Enforce authentication and authorization on content retrieval, returning data according to the App-side setting:
    -   "Only me and shared recipients": return content only if the requester is authenticated and is the owner or on the share list/holds a valid share token; otherwise 403.
    -   "Allow everyone": provide restricted content with risk controls (rate limiting, anomaly detection, minimized fields).
-   Anti-enumeration and risk controls: rate limiting, anomaly pattern detection, signed/expiring tokens, minimal responses.

## Impact Assessment

-   No evidence of malicious exploitation: logs show no abnormal bulk access or exfiltration.
-   Post-fix risk reduction: default is "Only me and shared recipients," significantly reducing overexposure.
-   Data integrity unaffected: read-only exposure; no write-path or core logic impact.

## User Action

-   Please update to App 1.1.0 and review the "Tap Access Permission" setting (default: Only me and shared recipients).
-   Avoid sharing screenshots/links containing deviceId publicly; when sharing, use in-App sharing with signed, time-limited links.
