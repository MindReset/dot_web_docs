## Who We Are

Shenzhen MindReset Technology Co., Ltd. (MindReset) is an innovative startup team in electronic products and interaction solutions, founded in March 2024 in Shenzhen, China. We have launched our core brand, Dot.

The Dot. brand is designed for young consumers who pursue a quality lifestyle, aiming to address the widespread issues of information overload and notification fatigue in modern society. Our ultimate goal is to enable tech products to blend gracefully into home or office environments, becoming personalized, non-intrusive “information windows” that help users stay focused and calm in the information age—bringing technology back to its original purpose of service in a more streamlined and efficient way.

Currently, the Dot. product lineup includes:

-   **Quote/0 (Excerpt)**: A personalized information e‑ink device. It uses an approximately 2.66‑inch electronic ink display to elegantly present user‑customized content such as RSS subscriptions, weather, reminders, and quotes, with an always‑on, no‑backlight design.
-   **More Innovations**: We are actively developing products such as Date/0 (Retro Interactive Clock), Date/1 (Desktop AI Calendar), Memo/0 (Memo Window), and Card/0 (Magnetic Smart Card), continuously exploring the application potential of e‑ink technology across different scenarios.

## Core Team

MindReset is composed of young members passionate about technological innovation. Our core team brings complementary expertise and hands‑on experience in hardware design, embedded development, software and app development, web service infrastructure, and user experience design. We value efficient collaboration and continuous innovation, striving to fuse cutting‑edge technology with human‑centered design to create products that truly meet user needs.
