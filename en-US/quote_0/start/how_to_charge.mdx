Quote/0 charges via a Type‑C cable and supports dual Type‑C sink mode, which means it is compatible with most chargers.

Charging takes approximately 1.5 hours. For first-time use, we recommend fully charging the device.

When you connect power, a white status light next to the Quote/0 power port will turn on. A blinking light indicates charging; a steady light indicates the battery is fully charged.
