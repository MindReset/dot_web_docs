## What is an API?

An API (Application Programming Interface) is a bridge for communication and data exchange between different software applications. Simply put, an API is like a "translator" or "waiter" that helps different programs "talk" to each other.

## How does an API work?

<Steps>
  <Step>
### You send a request

"Please display 'The weather is great today' on the device."

  </Step>
    <Step>
### The API processes the request

After receiving the request, the API performs identity and device verification to ensure it comes from a legitimate user and device.

  </Step>
    <Step>
### The device performs the action

The device receives the command and displays the text on the screen.

  </Step>
    <Step>
### Return the result
"Operation successful. The content is now displayed on the device."

  </Step>
</Steps>
