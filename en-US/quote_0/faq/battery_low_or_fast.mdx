Quote/0 is a smart home device with a low-power autonomous wake design. It ships with about 70% battery and is recommended for use only in a stable home environment.

<Callout type="info">
	<include>../start/how_to_charge.mdx</include>
</Callout>

When powered solely by battery under good signal conditions, with a default update interval of 3 hours or longer, battery life can last up to one year.

If you notice that Quote/0’s battery is draining too quickly, please note there are two possible reasons:

1. Update interval is too short: If you set the update interval to less than 3 hours, the device will wake and fetch content more frequently, causing the battery to drain faster than expected. You can set a longer update interval in the app to significantly reduce power consumption.
2. Poor Wi‑Fi network: If your Wi‑Fi environment is poor, you use a phone hotspot, or you leave the original network when the device wakes, the device may consume power quickly due to repeated Wi‑Fi reconnection attempts. For this smart‑home‑class device, the specific reconnection logic is:
    - After a no‑response or error, the device automatically retries 15 times in a loop;
    - If all attempts fail, the device sleeps for two minutes, then automatically wakes and retries;
    - This cycle repeats until the device successfully connects to Wi‑Fi.

Therefore, please check the Wi‑Fi the device is currently using to ensure power consumption remains reasonable.
